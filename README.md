# Form-Validator-
Creating this simple form validator in javascript :smile:
Form Validation is really important while signing up for newsletter or signing up for something else. Hence this is a simple form validator made using JavaScript. It does not consist of backend for storing the information but it does tell you if you have added relevant information.
